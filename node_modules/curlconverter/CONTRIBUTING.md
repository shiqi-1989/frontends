First, make sure you're running **Node 14** or greater.

If you add a new generator, you'll need to

- export it in [index.ts](src/index.ts)
- update the list of supported languages in [cli.ts](src/cli.ts) (or it won't be accessible from the command line)
- add it to [test-utils.ts](test/test-utils.ts) (to make it part of the testing)
- add it to [README.md](./README.md)

If you want to add new functionality, start with a test.

- create a file containing the curl command in [test/fixtures/curl_commands/](test/fixtures/curl_commands) with a descriptive filename like `post_with_headers.sh`
- run `npm run gen-test post_with_headers` to save the result of converting that file to [test/fixtures/\<language>/](test/fixtures) with a matching filename but different file extension like `post_with_headers.py`
- modifying the parser in [util.ts](src/util.ts) or the generators in [src/generators/](src/generators) and re-run `npm run gen-test` until your test is converted correctly
- run `npm test` to make sure the new test passes

The parser generates a generic data structure consumed by code generator functions.

You can run a specific test with:

```sh
npm test -- --test test_name
```

where `test_name` is a file (with or without the `.sh` extension) in [test/fixtures/curl_commands/](test/fixtures/curl_commands)

You can run only the tests for a specific language generator with:

```sh
npm test -- --language python
```
